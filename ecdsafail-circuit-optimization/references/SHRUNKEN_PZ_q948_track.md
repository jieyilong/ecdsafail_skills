# The Shrunken-PZ Low-Qubit Track — and How q948 Broke the 952q Wall

**Scope:** the Proos–Zalka / "Shrunken-PZ" reversible secp256k1 EC point-add inversion route. This is the **qubit-minimization** line of work — *structurally separate* from the `trailmix_ludicrous` **product-min** line (see `REPORT_1168_wall_revamp.md`). They share nothing but the problem statement (in-place affine `P += Q`): different module (`src/point_add/trailmix_port/inversion/`), different inversion engine (a 530-step binary-GCD/Kaliski **divstep** state machine, not the jump-GCD + Karatsuba ludicrous arithmetic), different objective.

**Status (2026-06-21):** nasqret's `a203fac` reached **948 qubits** — the lowest peak ever on this route, breaking the prior **952q** wall — but it is **score-rejected**: 948q × 54,781,961 Toffoli = 51.9B (+468%). The PZ divstep inversion is inherently gate-heavy (~54.8M Toffoli ≈ **40× the ludicrous SOTA's 1.36M**, ~33× over the 948q product break-even of `1,581,316,420 / 948 ≈ 1.67M`). **The PZ track is a qubit-lower-bound witness, not a product-min contender.** Lineage of rejected qubit records: 1050q (trailmix) → 1019q (teddyjfpender) → 988→956 (the "lever stack", see SKILL §"Shrunken-PZ Q988→Q956") → 952q (`0ce9b13`) → 948q (`a203fac`) → **851q (`e7dd3de`, 6/23 — an explicit *analysis oracle*, not a circuit; 464.5M Toffoli, +3659%; §8) → 829q (`1dd61ca`, 6/24 — a three-way race down the same oracle, §9).** Everything below 948q is the analysis-oracle regime: validates 0/0/0 only on its island, ~400–500M Toffoli (~250× over the product break-even), `FRESH_VALIDITY_CLAIMED=false`, acceptance blocked.

Why document a rejected route: the *qubit-shrinking technique* is genuinely novel and reusable (it is the qubit-side analogue of the ludicrous "empirical dead-CCX" lever — both are robust empirical envelopes projected from limiting witnesses), and it is the live frontier of "how low can the inversion go."

---

## 1. The PZ qubit model — 530 divstep rows, 5 width components, 681 + 267 = 948

The inversion is a **530-step binary-GCD extended-Euclid (Kaliski) divstep** state machine (`SHRUNKEN_PZ_NSTEPS = 530`, `shrunken_pz_schedule.rs:16`; one envelope **row** per divstep). Each row holds **5 working registers** whose live widths set the peak:

| component | register | width trajectory |
|---|---|---|
| `wa`, `wb` | **A, B** — the two running EEA/GCD magnitudes | start 256/256, **descend** toward 1 as the GCD shrinks |
| `wca`, `wcb` | **CA, CB** — the two Bézout cofactors (the modular-inverse accumulators) | start 1/1, **grow** toward 256 |
| `wq` | **Q** — the per-step quotient | ~21–25 bits (capped 99 via `TRAILMIX_Q_CAP`) |

Registers are laid out as **symmetric pairs**: `trailmix_register_widths_step` returns `[ab, ab, cacb, cacb, q]` with `ab = max(wa,wb)`, `cacb = max(wca,wcb)` (`shrunken_pz_state_machine.rs:201-205`) — A/B physically share the larger width, CA/CB share theirs, so the reversible conditional add/swap is clean.

**Peak-qubit formula** (`shrunken_pz_state_machine.rs:114-115`):
```
peak_at_step = 2·max(wa,wb) + 2·max(wca,wcb) + wq + FIXED
             = (sum of the 5 symmetric width components) + FIXED
```
The peak row is **row 363, the GCD crossover** — `[81,81,248,248,23]`, sum **681** (A/B shrunk to 81, cofactors grown to 248, quotient 23; 7 rows tie at 681). Total = **681 (peak working width) + 267 fixed = 948**. The ~267 fixed qubits are the non-resizable lanes: the 257-bit field coordinates / `dx,dy,lambda`, the modulus, EEA sign/parity, the affine step counter (collapsed to **1 lane** via `q949_affine_counter_requested`, `:94-96`), and transient CLZ/comparator ancilla.

So **lowering the peak = lowering the maximum-over-rows of the 5-component width sum.** That maximum is `Q949_ROBUST_PEAK_SAFE_SUM = 681`.

---

## 2. CLZ-context width narrowing — the structural lever

The divstep arithmetic (bit-length-difference + the controlled A↔B / CA↔CB add-subtract) only needs to touch bits **above a provably-zero low region**. Because A,B share a magnitude class and CA,CB share theirs, in a given **count-leading-zeros (CLZ) context** the low bits of a register are provably zero, so the reversible op runs over a **narrowed window `[lo .. len)`** instead of the full register. Implemented directly: the scan loops run `for k in (lo..src.len()).rev()` and the effective width is `aw = a.len() − lo_a` (`shrunken_pz_state_machine.rs:1594,1757-1758`).

`clz_safe_low_upper_bounds[row][register]` (4 registers A,B,CA,CB — Q is excluded, no leading-zero structure) is the **per-(row,register) maximum safe `lo`** — the largest low-window you can skip while still covering every observed input. This is what makes a row's *physical* width smaller than its naïve GCD magnitude.

---

## 3. How the robust envelope breaks 952 → 948

**Prior 952q (`0ce9b13`) = a single Monte-Carlo "thin schedule."** It baked `q952_thin_schedule.bin` (5,352 B) produced by `generate_thin_schedule()` (`shrunken_pz_schedule.rs:847+`): a seeded-RNG width search with train/validate/held-out splits and `repair_sample`, yielding **one global pack** that saturated the working budget `Q949_TARGET_SUM = 683`. Its route ladder bottomed at **952** (`lowq_q952_srot_counter567`). No robust/948 path exists in that dir (zero `q949_robust` references).

**a203fac 948q = a per-row, per-register, CLZ-context-conditional "robust row envelope," projected from worst-case witnesses.** It *replaces* the thin schedule with `q949_robust_envelope.rs` (+ `q949_robust_envelope_data.rs`, a 10.5 MB embedded artifact via `include!`). `q949_robust_symmetric_schedule_requested()` (`shrunken_pz_schedule.rs:714-750`) pulls per-row `widths` and CLZ `lows` from the envelope instead of recomputing a global budget. The envelope is the **tightest width/CLZ-low schedule that still covers every one of 12,590 empirical CLZ *limiting witnesses*** (`CLZ_LIMITING_WITNESSES = 12590`) — the worst-case inputs bounding each of **2,088 CLZ contexts** (`CLZ_CONTEXTS = 2088`, only **2** unconstrained) — drawn from **14 training streams** (`Q949_ROBUST_TRAINING_STREAMS = 14`).

**The squeeze (683 → 681 → −4 qubits):** the static-thin route saturated `TARGET_SUM = 683`; the robust envelope's actual maximum row sum is **681** (`PEAK_SAFE_SUM = 681`, `minimum_pair_symmetric_slack == 2` asserted in `parse_envelope`, `q949_robust_envelope.rs:390`). By projecting per-(row,register) CLZ-safe lows from the *real witness set* instead of a uniform global cap, the crossover rows (363–364) come in at 681 not 683. Combined with the **1-lane affine counter** and a direct-HCLZ peak-guard path (`LOWQ_Q948_DIRECT_HCLZ_PEAK_GUARD` + the robust schedule, route ladder `:1784-1789`), the total drops 952 → **948**. (Row 370 is a hand-repaired exception: `Q949_REPAIRED_ROW = 370`, pack `[78,78,255,255,17]`, all CLZ scans pinned to 78 lanes.)

**The meta-pattern:** this is the qubit-side twin of the ludicrous **empirical dead-CCX elimination** — *simulate many reachable inputs, find the limiting witnesses, project the tightest bound that covers them, bake + hash-seal it.* There the bound is "which CCX never fire"; here it is "how narrow each divstep register can be." Both trade a provable-for-all-inputs guarantee for a witness-validated, distribution-exact one that goes measurably tighter.

---

## 4. Correctness regime — witness-validated, NOT proven for all inputs

`Q949_ROBUST_ENVELOPE_FRESH_VALIDITY_CLAIMED = false` (`q949_robust_envelope.rs:127`); every training stream carries `proof_status: "reject"`, `training_only: true`. The envelope is fit to the **specific trained tail-nonces** (1,3,4,5,7,8,11,12,15,16,20,21,24). Consequences:

- **Island-exact** → the submission validates **0/0/0** (classical/phase/ancilla) on its island precisely because the narrowed CLZ windows never lose a bit for any input the projection was built to cover.
- **Not robust to distribution shift** → a fresh input stream can produce a CLZ context whose true safe-low exceeds the projected bound (an *uncovered* witness), silently truncating a high bit. Hence `FRESH_VALIDITY_CLAIMED=false`. This is **structurally weaker than the 952q baseline**, which carried a train/validate/held-out *safety margin*; the robust envelope is tighter *because* it is fit to the witness set with no margin.
- **Integrity wall** → `parse_envelope` re-derives `compact_projection_sha256()` and asserts equality with the sealed `Q949_ROBUST_PROJECTION_SHA256`, plus `ENVELOPE_SHA256` and `ARTIFACT_BYTES = 10,545,370` and the full training provenance. **Any input-stream change requires re-projecting and re-sealing the envelope** (a new selection certificate / job id; currently 71581). The metadata even records `generator_model: "GPT-Codex"` — the projection was produced offline by a code-gen tool.

---

## 5. Why it is still score-rejected (and what would change that)

948q is the lowest peak on this route, but the **product loses by ~33×**. The Toffoli cost (~54.78M) is structural to the PZ divstep inversion, not incidental:
- **530 record/replay divsteps**, each a controlled bit-length-difference (`direct_bitlen_diff_*`) + controlled A↔B / CA↔CB conditional add-subtract + a per-step quotient.
- **Per-step CLZ / leading-zero computations** to drive the narrowed windows — the very mechanism that buys the qubits costs gates.
- **Variable-width Cuccaro adds** + the per-transition resize/rebalance machinery (`shrunken_pz_rebalance_pack`, shrink+resize each of the 5 registers forward and reverse).

To become product-competitive at ~948q you would need Toffoli **< ~1.67M** — a ~33× reduction, i.e. a fundamentally cheaper inversion (not a packing tweak). That is why the corollary holds: **pushing the PZ qubit floor lower does not help the product**; the action stays in the 1159–1164q ludicrous band. The PZ track's value is as a *witness* (proving 948q is reachable for this inversion on a validated island) and as a *source of reusable robust-envelope technique*.

## 6. The 952 → 948 delta at a glance

| | Prior 952q (`0ce9b13`) | a203fac 948q |
|---|---|---|
| width source | `q952_thin_schedule.bin` (5,352 B, single Monte-Carlo global pack) | `q949_robust_envelope.rs` + `_data.rs` (10.5 MB, per-row/per-register CLZ-conditional envelope) |
| robust refs | 0 | full `Q949RobustEnvelope` struct |
| peak working sum | saturates `TARGET_SUM = 683` | `PEAK_SAFE_SUM = 681` (slack 2) |
| route-ladder floor | 952 (`q952_srot_counter567`) | 946/947/**948** (`direct_hclz_peak_guard` + affine counter) |
| step counter | counter-width route | affine counter → **1 lane** |
| validity | train/validate/held-out *margin* | witness-covered, **no margin**, `FRESH_VALIDITY_CLAIMED=false`, 12,590 witnesses / 14 streams, SHA-sealed |
| objective fit | qubit witness (rejected) | qubit witness (rejected, +468%) |

## 7. Reusable lessons

1. **Robust empirical envelope (the transferable technique).** To push *any* variable-width / variable-support schedule past where a single Monte-Carlo schedule saturates: enumerate the **limiting witnesses** (worst-case inputs per context) across many streams, project the **tightest bound that covers all of them**, bake it as a per-context table, and **hash-seal it to its training provenance**. The win comes from making the bound *conditional* (per-row, per-register, per-CLZ-context) rather than a single global cap. Same shape as the ludicrous dead-CCX `.idx`.
2. **It buys what it can't prove.** A witness-fit envelope with *no* safety margin (`FRESH_VALIDITY_CLAIMED=false`) is tighter than a margined schedule but only island-exact — it must be re-projected on any distribution change, and it is the right tool only when you can re-validate 0/0/0 on the shipped island.
3. **CLZ-context width narrowing** is the PZ-specific structural lever: a divstep register can run on `[lo..len)` whenever its leading-zero context certifies the low bits never carry. Worth porting to any GCD/EEA where register magnitudes have predictable leading-zero structure.
4. **But know when the track is a dead end for *score*.** The PZ inversion's ~54.8M Toffoli is ~33× over the product break-even at 948q. Qubit records here are witnesses; do not spend product-race effort on them unless the objective changes to pure-qubit-min (it has not — the 948q rejection at +468% confirms the active objective is the product).

## 8. The 851q "analysis oracle" (`e7dd3de`, nasqret, 6/23) — qubit record, but NOT a circuit

`e7dd3de` (submission `341d096`) drops the PZ peak from 948q to **851q** (−97), but is **rejected at +3659%**: 851 × **464,495,956** = 395B, ~250× over the product break-even (`~1.578B / 851 ≈ 1.85M` Toffoli would be needed; it delivers ~250× that). Toffoli **exploded ~8.5×** vs the 948q's 54.8M. Crucially, **it is not a reversible-circuit implementation at all** — the modules say so themselves (`register_shared_eea.rs`: *"an analysis oracle, not a reversible circuit implementation … passing this oracle does not establish a challenge-valid qubit count"*; `q945_local_hosts.rs`: *"Q945 acceptance remains blocked until the Q946 hardening prerequisites … are integrated"*). So 851q is a *combinatorial* lower-bound model, weaker even than the witness-validated 948q.

**The −97 qubit mechanism (three stacked levers, files under `trailmix_port/inversion/`):**
1. **Dirty-catalytic ancilla** (`q944_dirty_catalytic_predicate.rs`): the identity `G^d; d^=f; G^d; d^=f = G^f` lets an already-live ("dirty") register lane `d` be borrowed as the control rail for a gate and **restored exactly** — no clean ancilla allocated (`Q944CatalyticProxy::rewrite` asserts `allocation_serial`/`active_qubits` invariance). Each borrowed CCX is emitted *twice* (lender-cancellation), via `emit_controlled_by_dirty`.
2. **Gate hosting into existing lanes** (`q944_gate_host_feasibility.rs`/`_lifecycle.rs`, `q945_local_hosts.rs`): place a gate's transient ancilla inside a register lane proven zero at gate entry/exit by an empirical support census (`Q944_GATE_HOST_CENSUS_JOB=71935`), with per-row borrow tables (`Q945_DIVISION_PARITY_HOSTS`/`Q945_MULTIPLY_PARITY_HOSTS`) naming exactly which `A/B/CA/CB/Q` lane+bit hosts each divstep gate. `q944_full_structural.rs` closes the route: 9 "ordinary" hosted classes + 5 "division" classes falling back to `QuotientWitness`.
3. **Register-shared EEA — the dominant −97** (`register_shared_eea.rs`, porting **Luo et al. 2026**): A, B and a *single shared cofactor lane* (CA/CB share physical lanes) → `REGISTER_SHARED_PAPER_INVERSION_QUBITS = 3·256 + 52 = 820` inversion qubits, vs the q948 envelope's A+B+CA+CB working sum. The 851 = this ~820 register-shared core + point-add framing. Levers (1)/(2) remove the clean scratch lanes that would otherwise block the sharing. (Ladder: 948 → 945 → 944 [single-digit lane shavings from borrowing] → 851 [register-sharing collapse].)

**Why Toffoli explodes 8.5× — the qubit↔Toffoli-DEPTH reciprocal violation, in the flesh.** Hosting one Toffoli costs `toggle_gate; ccx; toggle_gate` where `toggle_gate` is a **full-width comparator** recomputed before *and* after the borrowed gate — `q944_gate_host_lifecycle.rs` asserts `ccx ≈ 12·width + 3 ≈ 3075` Toffoli to realize **one** useful Toffoli at width 256 (`q944_catalytic_cost ≈ 12·width+2`). Division rows are worse: `q944_dirty_arithmetic_toffoli = 2·width² + width + 1`, ×25 distributed ≈ 3.3M per call. Across **530 divsteps** (`SHRUNKEN_PZ_NSTEPS`), the surrounded-comparator envelope lands at ~4.6×10⁸ — matching the 464.5M. This is exactly the trailmix metric-model warning: **the saved lanes are paid back as full-width recompute/uncompute on both sides of every borrowed gate, so the trade is super-linear, not 1:1** — the qubit minimum and the score minimum are *not* reached by the same construction.

**Lesson.** Dirty-catalytic / gate-hosting / register-sharing are the genuine route below ~948q on qubits, and the Luo-2026 register-shared EEA is the structural source worth knowing. But on the *product* objective they are anti-levers: every borrowed lane costs a full-width comparator round-trip × 530. And `e7dd3de` is not even a shippable circuit — it's an oracle that *models* the qubit count assuming the hosting is free, then charges the hosting Toffoli. Treat sub-948q PZ numbers as combinatorial lower-bound claims, not circuits.

---

## 9. The 851 → 829 race (6/23–6/24): a three-way leapfrog on one frozen-envelope oracle

After 851q, **three competitors — nasqret, gopikannappan, gnuchev — leapfrogged the qubit record down to 829q** over ~26 hours, all rejected at +3,100–4,000%. Two structural facts frame the whole race:

- **It is ONE shared oracle, not three forks.** Every rung edits the *same* three files (`register_shared_eea_reference.rs`, `arith/khattar_gidney.rs`, and the `LOWQ_*` flag ladder in `mod.rs`), each commit building on (and sometimes *reverting*) the previous submitter's flags. The clearest proof: nasqret's 844q (`1b836a8`) explicitly **reverts gopikannappan's 846q dirty-ladder** (restores the prior nonce + capacity). The reference file grows monotonically 705 KB → 951 KB. It is one accreting analysis oracle pushed turn-by-turn.
- **829q is exactly as disclaimed as 851q.** `register_shared_eea.rs`'s *"analysis oracle, not a reversible circuit implementation"* line is **byte-identical** at 851 and 829; `Q949_ROBUST_ENVELOPE_FRESH_VALIDITY_CLAIMED = false` and `proof_status:"reject"` hold at every rung; census `job_id`s (71119–71581) all carry `"reject"`. **The 829q is no more a valid circuit than the 851q** — same island-only 0/0/0, same ~250×-over-break-even regime.

**Crucial: the q949 robust width-envelope is FROZEN across the whole race** (`maximum_pair_symmetric_sum = 681`, `target_sum = 683`, `row_count = 530`, `job_id = 71581`, all constant; the JSON blob hash flips only on CRLF). So the 851→829 drop does **not** come from re-projecting the width packing (§3). It comes entirely from **more borrowing / more register-sharing / more gate-hosting** of the *fixed* lanes — i.e. extending §8's three levers, not the §2/§3 width lever.

**Per-rung marginal technique** (Δq / Toffoli direction / mechanism):

| rung | Δq | Toffoli | marginal lever |
|---|---|---|---|
| 851→**850** `903ac93` | −1 | 464M→472M **↑** | **dirty-borrow MCX**: `detector_mcx`/`unary_iterate_log_star_borrowed` (`khattar_gidney.rs:733,754`) replace clean-ancilla `mcx_clean_k` with `mcx_dirty` borrowing a live lane on the all-ones detector — *"removes the top scratch qubit at the inversion peak, trading a few extra Toffoli for one fewer peak qubit."* |
| 850→**846** `43ad642` | −4 | 472M→509M **↑↑** | **dirty-borrow at scale**: `mcx_dirty_ladder` — a flat dirty-ladder all-ones detector over all counter bits, eliminating the KG prefix-AND block + the `uls_gate` lane. Most Toffoli-expensive rung (+36M for 4 qubits). |
| 846→**844** `1b836a8` | −2 | 509M→464M **↓** | **register-share + revert the bad borrow**: undoes the 846 dirty-ladder, then `Q845SwapOnlyAddress::InPlaceLS` hosts the 9-lane swap address *inside* the existing `l_s` register via `increment_mod_2n_refs` — in-place Cuccaro instead of round-trips → reclaims the 36M. |
| 844→**843** `cbbf3f0` | −1 | 464M→450M **↓** | **gate-host + comparator narrow**: `borrowed_sign` takes the sign lane from `scratch[3]` (one fewer lane on `length`); narrower `length` → shorter `cuccaro_sub_mod_2n_refs` → fewer Toffoli. Qubit and Toffoli move together. |
| 843→**842** `faec502` | −1 | 450M→437M **↓** | **cheaper restore**: `cuccaro_{add,sub}_mod_2n_refs_target_refs` store the overflow in the existing sign lane instead of materializing an (n+1)-bit boundary — one fewer lane + one fewer Cuccaro round. |
| 842→**839** `be568e6` | −3 | 437M→**405M ↓↓** | **split-high comparator narrowing (the big Toffoli win)**: `bit_length_lean_allow_zero_…_split_{high,two,three,four}_high` omit the top 1–4 source bits from the Cuccaro round-trip (`length_width = signed_width − borrowed_underflow − omitted_split_bits`) and reconstruct them combinatorially — fewer comparator bits × every EEA iteration ≈ −32M. 12 new `LOWQ_SUB800_*` flags. |
| 839→**838** `552e535` | −1 | 405M→423M **↑** | **borrow-to-buy-a-qubit**: `BORROW_PROMISED_SUPPORT_LENDER` borrows the live preserved dy/top lane for the swap-length workspace; the `ULS_DIRECT_SELECTOR` reroute to make it legal costs ~+18M. |
| 838→**837** `7386c44` | −1 | 423M→**402M ↓ (floor)** | **genuine adder opt + re-host**: `controlled_{increment,decrement}_mod_2n_short_carry` use n−2 carries — *"the final ripple carry feeds the top-bit Toffoli directly instead of a redundant n−1st lane"* — removing one CCX/CX per modular inc/dec across the ladder. Qubit drop: `l_q.rebuilt` → `SUB820_L_Q_WIDTH=8`, freed bit re-hosted on the kept-live `lambda_top`. |
| 837→**829** `1dd61ca` | **−8 (record)** | 402M→448M **↑** | **"metadata relocation" = dirty-borrow at scale**: `conditional_work_and_length_swap_direct_metadata` eliminates the full-width `l_t_prime` swap scratch; `coefficient_fused_data_and_sign_q845_swap_only` relocates the coefficient cursor + counter onto the **8 borrowed `l_q` lender lanes**. Removes ~8 qubits at once; +45M from per-swap compute/uncompute round-trips. Flags `LOWQ_Q830_DIRECT_SWAP_METADATA` + `LOWQ_Q830_COEFFICIENT_COUNTER_RELOCATION`. |

**The race is a sawtooth.** Two forces alternate: a **borrow/relocation step** buys 1–8 qubits and spikes Toffoli (851→850 +8M, 850→846 +36M, 839→838 +18M, 837→829 +45M), then a **comparator/adder-cleanup step** claws Toffoli back (846→844 −44M revert, 842→839 −32M split-high, 838→837 −20M short-carry). The Toffoli **floor (~402M at 837q) never drops below ~250× the product break-even** — so the entire 851→829 descent is pure qubit-axis motion on a frozen width envelope, paid for in recompute, inside the same disclaimed oracle.

#### Mechanism deep-dive (the actual code)

*(Files under `src/point_add/trailmix_port/`. The reference model `inversion/register_shared_eea_reference.rs`, classical oracle `inversion/register_shared_eea.rs`, dirty-MCX `arith/mcx.rs` + `arith/khattar_gidney.rs`, and the bit-length engine in `inversion/shrunken_pz_state_machine.rs`. Line numbers are from `git show <commit>:<path>` — these files exist in the submission commits, not at the ludicrous HEAD. Submissions are sibling squashes, so "new code" was localized by diffing consecutive submissions in date order.)*

**(1) The register-shared EEA state layout.** The Luo-2026 packing keeps the extended-Euclid state in **two 259-lane "work words" + five length trackers + 4 control bits** — `struct RegisterSharedCore` (`register_shared_eea_reference.rs:13142`): `work1`/`work2` (`REGISTER_SHARED_WORK_WIDTH=259` = 257 field bits + 2 pad), and `l_t, l_t_prime, l_q, l_s, l_r_prime` (the metadata). The classical oracle (`register_shared_eea.rs:103-134`) shows what they *mean*: `Work1{ t, q, r, l_t, l_q }` packs the Bézout cofactor `t`, the in-flight quotient `q`, and operand-A magnitude `r`; `Work2{ t_prime, r_prime, l_r_prime, l_s }` packs the other cofactor `t_prime` and operand-B magnitude `r_prime` (the reflected denominator), **rotated low by `l_s`** (`l_s` is a rotation *cursor*, not a magnitude — `rotate_low_small(work2_raw, width, l_s)`). The packing invariant `l_t + 1 + l_q + bitlen(r) ≤ n+3` (`assert_boundary_invariants`) is what makes A and its cofactor share one physical word — register-sharing *is* this packing. Widths: `REFERENCE_LENGTH_WIDTH=9` (each length tracker), `SUB820_L_Q_WIDTH=8`, `REFERENCE_STEPS=1479` (the driver runs `register_shared_scheduled_step_*` for all 1,479 steps).

**(2) Dirty-borrow MCX (850/846).** Clean baseline `mcx_clean_k` (`mcx.rs:223`) computes `target ^= AND(ctrls)`; for `k=3,4,5` it allocates fresh clean scratch (`mcxk_t3`/`mcxk_t01_4`/…), for `k≥6` it uses the Khattar–Gidney log\*-ancilla prefix-AND (clean block `uls_anc`). `mcx_dirty(ctrls, target, psi)` (`mcx.rs:101`) does the same with **one already-live dirty lane `psi`** via a Barenco "surrounded" decomposition — the k=3 core is `ccx(c0,c1,psi); ccx(psi,c2,target); ccx(c0,c1,psi); ccx(psi,c2,target)` (4 CCX vs 3 CCX + 1 clean lane), and `psi` is asserted restored. **850** (`detector_mcx`/`unary_iterate_log_star_borrowed`, `khattar_gidney.rs:737`) routes the per-iteration all-ones detector through `mcx_dirty` → removes the `mcxk_t3` gate scratch ("the top scratch qubit at the inversion peak"). **846** (`mcx_dirty_ladder`, `mcx.rs:17`, `4k−8` CCX, restores every lender) borrows the live cursor lanes as a *flat dirty ladder*, eliminating the **entire `uls_anc` prefix-AND block** + the `uls_gate` lane (gateless direct-target mode) — which is why 846 buys 4 qubits but costs +36M.

**(3) Split-high comparator narrowing (839, −32M).** The per-divstep test is `bitlen(source) ≷ boundary`; `bit_length_lean_direct_prefix` (`shrunken_pz_state_machine.rs:684`) computes `bitlen` by adding the constant `n` and subtracting a unit per all-zero prefix, and takes `omitted_high_bits ∈ {1,2,3,4}` (the `_split_high`/`_split_two_high`/… wrappers, `:1345-1445`). The comparator `controlled_xor_saturating_difference_inplace_boundary` then runs the full **Cuccaro subtractor only over the narrowed low width** `length_width = signed_width − borrowed_underflow − omitted_split_bits` (`register_shared_eea_reference.rs:4444`), and reconstructs the omitted top 1–4 bits **combinatorially** with a borrow-ripple ANF instead of a Cuccaro round-trip: `toggle_subtraction_borrow_anf` (`:4317`) emits `br(x,y,b)=y⊕b⊕yb⊕xy⊕xb` as `cx(y,t); cx(b,t); ccx(y,b,t); ccx(x,y,t); ccx(x,b,t)`, chained borrow→borrow across the high bits, then run in reverse to restore the borrowed lanes. **Replacing a width-`signed_width` Cuccaro round-trip with a few CX/CCX per step, ×1,479 steps × fwd+rev ≈ −32M** — and it shrinks the comparator's transient scratch (qubits *and* Toffoli the same direction).

**(4) Short-carry adder (837 floor, −20M).** `controlled_increment_mod_2n_short_carry` (`register_shared_eea_reference.rs:9037`) requires exactly **`n−2` carry lanes**: the carry chain is `ccx(ctrl,reg[0],carries[0]); cx(ctrl,reg[0]); for i in 1..n-2: ccx(reg[i],carries[i-1],carries[i]); ccx(reg[n-2], carries[n-3], reg[n-1])`. The **last materialized carry feeds *directly* as a control of the single top-bit Toffoli** instead of being propagated into a redundant `n−1`st lane — so one carry lane *and* one CCX/CX are saved per modular inc/dec across the ladder. `controlled_decrement_..._short_carry` (`:9072`) is the exact gate inverse.

**(5) Metadata relocation (829 record, −8q in one move).** `l_t_prime` is the full-width **9-lane swap-staging length register** for the cofactor (used by the legacy `conditional_work_and_length_swap_under_zero_predicate`). `conditional_work_and_length_swap_direct_metadata` (`:7249`) does the `A→A⊕B→B` exchange with **no `l_t_prime` parameter** — it recomputes the swapped `l_t` *in place* from the packed work words via `controlled_xor_rotated_prefix_bit_length(...)`, and the lane swap is just `cswap(control, l_r_prime[i], l_q[i])` + `controlled_swap_registers(control, work1, work2)`. So `l_t_prime`'s allocation drops **9 → 1** (`register_shared_initialize:13221`, gated on `q830_coefficient_counter_relocation_requested()`). The coefficient cursor (8 lanes) + the 9-lane population counter are then **hosted on the 8 borrowed `l_q` lender lanes** (`coefficient_fused_data_and_sign_q845_swap_only:11532`, `callback_cursor_scratch = relocation_l_q[..6]`, `SUB820_L_Q_WIDTH=8`) — the 844 `Q845SwapOnlyAddress::InPlaceLS(&l_s)` trick generalized. The **8 disappearing lanes are the `l_t_prime` register** (9→1). Flags `LOWQ_Q830_DIRECT_SWAP_METADATA` + `LOWQ_Q830_COEFFICIENT_COUNTER_RELOCATION`.

**(6) Peak accounting.** `profile_reference_scheduled_inversion` (`:22622`): `inversion_state_qubits = 2·259 + 5·9 + 4 = 567` (two work words + five length trackers + 4 control), `passenger_qubits = 257`, on top of the `Q949_ROBUST_PEAK_SAFE_SUM = 681` transient envelope (frozen, §3). The 851→829 race walks down exactly the **fixed metadata + comparator-scratch lanes**: detector ancilla `mcxk_t3`/`uls_anc` (850/846), Cuccaro-comparator round-trip width (839), the redundant `n−1`st carry lane (837), the in-place-hosted coefficient address (844), and the 9-lane `l_t_prime` swap register + cursor/counter (829). Width packing (the §3 envelope) is untouched throughout — every sub-948 qubit comes from borrowing/relocating a *fixed* lane, never from a narrower row.

**Lesson (extends §8).** The two PZ levers are decoupled: the **q949 robust width-envelope (§3)** sets the *packing* floor (681 working sum) and was frozen for this whole race; the **§8 borrow/share/host stack** is what actually moves sub-948, lane by lane, on top of that fixed packing. Both are below the soundness line — the entire 829 record is the §8 anti-lever pushed to its limit (relocate ever more EEA metadata onto already-live lender lanes), still an analysis oracle, still ~250× over the product. For *score* nothing here matters; for a future *pure-qubit-min* objective, the reusable idea is the **decoupling itself**: pack widths with the witness envelope, then borrow/host the fixed-lane scratch — but only the value-exact half of that (the register-sharing and split-high comparator narrowing, which moved qubits *and* Toffoli the same direction at 844/843/839) is worth porting; the dirty-borrow half pays it all back.
