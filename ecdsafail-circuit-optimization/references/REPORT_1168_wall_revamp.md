# Breaking the 1168q Wall: the `trailmix_ludicrous` Revamp, the 1167→1163q Cascade, and the Karatsuba/Bifurcation Burst

**Date:** 2026-06-19 → 2026-06-21
**Scope:** commits `bdb1d22` (tob-joe) through `20b9a1d` (mpjunior92) on `ecdsafail/ecdsafail-challenge` `main`.
**Objective recap:** `score = peak_qubits × avg_executed_Toffoli`, lower is better. The frontier sat at the dialog-GCD 1168q design (~1.43M Toffoli) for a long time. On 6/18 9:18 PM tob-joe submitted a *complete circuit revamp* that jumped to **1167q × 1,422,591 Toffoli = 1,660,163,697** (−8.9M score), and over the next ~15 hours a swarm drove it to **1163q × 1,412,402** (source commit `b310de9`, §2). Then a second burst (6/19 12:50 PM → 6/20 9:19 AM, §2.6) cut another ~40M Toffoli — headlined by a **Karatsuba modular square** (−22.4M in one commit) and a NAF recoding of the secp256k1 prime — and produced a genuine **qubit↔Toffoli bifurcation** (a 1159q low-qubit branch vs a 1164q low-Toffoli branch) that then **resolved into best-of-both** (`88ed0f5`/`d11bdbb`, 1159q × 1,380,711, re-stacking the 1159q headroom clamp on the cheap Karatsuba arithmetic). A third wave (6/20 10:42 AM → 4:10 PM, §2.7) *Toffoli-ground* that 1159q point to 1,378,242 (`f8e215b`) via comparator-window (`GAP_J2`) narrowing, converged-tail cswap elision, and removing the doubling ramp from the Karatsuba reduction. A fourth wave (6/20 6 PM → 6/21 7 AM, §2.8) then introduced **empirical dead-CCX elimination** — dropping CCX that never flip their target across ~9.2M reachable EC-point inputs — to reach the **current SOTA 1159q × 1,364,380 = 1,581,316,420** (submission `19cf407`, mpjunior92, source `20b9a1d`). Two parallel sub-1159q drops (`6ba606a` 1157q, `cde752d` 1156q) were promoted but both lost the product race to the 1159q grind.

## 0. The headline: this is a different circuit family

Everything before this was the **dialog-GCD** route (1168q). tob-joe's `bdb1d22` introduces a brand-new module `src/point_add/trailmix_ludicrous/` (+5001 lines, 11 files) and rewires `build()` to call `trailmix_ludicrous::build_trailmix_ludicrous_ops()` instead of the dialog builder. It is a port of Trail of Bits' **"ludicrous" product-min operating point** (a ~99.87%-per-add success-rate config) onto the challenge's `B` builder.

The structural thesis is simple and powerful:

> **Hold the second EC point `Q` entirely classically; never give it a resident quantum register. Compute the whole affine point-add as two GCD passes that share one modular-inversion primitive, with the inversion's dialog tape compressed live.**

That single decision (`Q` classical) is the **−512 qubit** product-min lever that gets the peak under 1168 to begin with. Everything after tob-joe is incremental Toffoli shaving plus **four** hard-won −1-qubit peak drops (1167→1166→1165→1164 *free* via constant-lane parking, then 1164→1163 *paid* by surrendering apply-phase vents — see §2.1 and §2.5).

## 1. The new circuit, end to end (`bdb1d22`, tob-joe)

### 1.1 Register layout (`mod.rs`)
Four 256-bit IO registers, allocation order pins the fuzzer IO ids:
- `x2` (reg0) — **quantum** `P.x` → `R.x`
- `y2` (reg1) — **quantum** `P.y` → `R.y`
- `ox` (reg2) — **classical `BitId`** `Q.x` (one value per shot; the verifier's runtime control)
- `oy` (reg3) — **classical `BitId`** `Q.y`

`Q` is two *classical* bit-registers, materialized into a transient 256-bit quantum temp **only** at the off-peak coordinate steps, then freed. A naive design that kept `ox` and `oy` as resident quantum registers would add 512 qubits live across the GCD peak. This is the decisive lever.

### 1.2 EC point-add dataflow (`ec_add.rs::ec_add`, the a-independent affine law)
Computes `(x2,y2) → P+Q` in place (generic add, `P≠±Q`):

```
3:  x2 -= ox                 dx = P.x − Q.x          (coord const-sub, transient temp)
4:  y2 -= oy                 dy = P.y − Q.y
6:  y2 *= x2^-1 mod q        GCD pass #1 (Inverse) → y2 = λ = dy·dx^-1 ; x2 restored to dx
7:  x2 += 3·ox               x2 = P.x + 2·Q.x        (coord_add3x: one fewer mod-add)
10: x2 -= λ^2 mod q          fused square-subtract
11: y2 *= x2 mod q           GCD pass #2 (Forward) → y2 = λ·x2
14: y2 -= oy                 (P+Q).y
15: x2 := ox − x2 mod q      zero-Toffoli negate: ox − x2 = −(x2 − ox)
```

Two things make this cheap:
- **Two GCD passes share one inversion primitive.** Both step 6 and step 11 call the *same* `mod_mul_inverse_in_place` engine, differing only by `Direction::Inverse` vs `Direction::Forward`. The slope `λ` is produced by the inversion itself — there is no separate field-inverse-then-multiply.
- **The negate (step 15) costs zero Toffoli.** `coord_rsub` uses `ox − x2 = −(x2 − ox)`: load classical coord (0-Toffoli `x_if_bit`), subtract, free, then `mod_neg` (a const-add of `f−1`). All X / const-add gates.

### 1.3 The modular-inversion engine: Schrottenloher jump-GCD (`gcd.rs`)
`mod_mul_inverse_in_place` realizes `y → y·x^±1 mod q` as **two passes sharing one tape**:
- **Forward** (`forward_gcd_jump`): a `JUMP=2`, `ITERS=258` binary-GCD divstep loop on `(u=q, v=x)`. Each step records a **3-bit dialog symbol `(subtracted, swap, s_2)`** plus a single global first-shift bit `t1`, and **compresses each window inline** the instant its symbols exist.
- **Reverse** (`reverse_gcd_jump`): the exact gate-inverse. It **decompresses one window at a time** from the tape end, applies the fused multiply, then inverts the divstep ops, restoring `x`.

Per-step divstep mechanics:
- **Shift-first** (jump=2): shift out low zero bits; `t1` records the step-0 even/odd choice; `s_2` flags the second (jump) shift.
- `subtracted = v[0]` post-shift → if odd, swap+subtract.
- **Swap decision** via a *narrow top-window* comparator (`comparator::controlled_swap_decision_lt_truncated`) — only scans `GAP_J2[i]` MSBs.
- **cswap + active-width subtract** `v −= subtracted·u` via `controlled_add_active`.
- **Kaliski odd-u bit-0 shortcut**: `u[0]==1` always, so the bit-0 carry-out is provably 0 — emit `cx(ctrl, y[0])` directly and run the capped adder on bits 1.. with carry-in 0 (~1000+ Toffoli saved across both passes).

**Shrink/regrow width schedule = the qubit floor.** `SCHED_J2[i]` (len 258) is the per-step active width: it holds at 256 for ~11 steps, then ramps to 13 by step 257. Each step frees the `u`/`v` qubits above the schedule width (`zero_and_free`); the reverse pass re-allocates them. The whole body (comparator, cswap, subtract) runs on `current_n = SCHED_J2[i]` bits, so **the adders run in the freed headroom**. This is the primary *lossy* lever — a `dx` whose bitlength exceeds the schedule width is rejected (it would make `zero_and_free` panic), which is exactly why the design needs a Fiat-Shamir nonce tail that lands all 9024 verifier draws in the schedule-supported set.

### 1.4 The all-triple base-5 codec (`codec.rs`) — resident tape 603q vs 772 raw
Only **5 of 8** `(subtracted, swap, s_2)` patterns are reachable, so a window of 3 symbols carries `log2(5^3) ≈ 6.97` bits and packs into a **7-bit code** (tighter than a K5 15→12 codec). Tiling: 1 `Step0` symbol (2 bits) + 85 `Triple`s (7 bits each) + 1 `Pair` tail (5 bits) + 1 `t1` bit = **603 resident qubits** vs `1 + 3×257 = 772` raw.

- **SAT-synthesized in-place pairs core** (`compress_2sym_fast`): a straight-line reversible `x/cx/ccx` circuit mapping the 25 valid 2-symbol inputs to 25 distinct 5-bit codes, freeing a wire; the terminal AND-uncompute is **vented** (HMR + conditional-Z, 0 Toffoli). The Triple codec is `pair → affine normalizer → fold-in s_2`.
- **Inline interleave + streamed decompression**: windows are compressed as produced (forward) and decompressed one-at-a-time (reverse), so the tape is never expanded all at once. The multiply *apply* is fused **into** the GCD passes, not run as a separate phase.

### 1.5 The vented-adder zoo + baked schedule tables (`gidney.rs`, `fused.rs`, `schedule.rs`)
Every adder vents its carry-uncompute via **Gidney-2025 measurement-based AND-uncompute (MBU)**: `hmr(carry,bit); cz_if_bit(a,b,bit)` — an X-basis measurement replacing the reverse-CCX with a conditional-Z, **0 Toffoli**. Each vent = −1 Toffoli, +1 transient qubit, held only between the forward/reverse carry chains.

The adder *family*, dispatched per-call by baked tables:
- plain Gidney AND-carry; variable-chunk (`varchunk`); headroom-adaptive (√n-chunk) → chunked-then-Cuccaro tail; cofactor-add cout core.
- A **fused double+cdouble** `y := 2(1+s_2)·y mod q` with one combined `(e+2d)·f` reduction instead of two separate `+f` adds.

`schedule.rs` bakes *every* per-call cost decision so the op-stream is deterministic and the peak is pinned: `GCD_SUB_K`, `GCD_BRANCH`, `APPLY_COUT_K`, `FOLD_SCHED`, `CMP_K`, `FFG_G`, `HYB_V`, `SQ_ROW_K`. Each adder's vent budget is set to exactly `CEILING − active_qubits` where `CEILING = 1167` — i.e. the schedule spends every spare qubit under the peak on vents (free Toffoli) and never exceeds it.

### 1.6 Deliberate exact-modular truncations (`arith.rs`)
`f = 2^32 + 977`, `PAD = 21`.
- **Low-54-bit `+f` fold** (`LSBS = PAD + F_BITLEN = 54`): every reduction fold touches only the low 54 bits; carry beyond bit 53 is dropped — wrong only with prob ~`2^-21` per fire on a uniform operand.
- **Narrow-top-window comparators** (`MSBS = PAD = 21`): overflow/swap predicates recompute on the top 21 bits only, cleaned by measurement-vent; a mis-decide happens only when the highest differing bit sits below the window (~`2^-21` / `2^-GAP` per call).

These are safe under the 9024-shot verifier because each is an independent ~`2^-21`-per-fire divergence; the common path is exact and the expected failing-shot count stays under tolerance. `PAD` is the master knob trading those rare misses for dropped-carry / narrow-comparator Toffoli savings.

### 1.7 Where 1167q and 1.42M Toffoli come from
- **Peak (1167)** is owned by the **forward-multiply GCD apply (step 11) cofactor-add hot path**: ~512 (two coord regs) + 603 (resident compressed tape) + early-width `u/v` + transient carry/vent ancilla. The −512q classical-`Q` lever and the 603-vs-772 tape compression are exactly what hold it at 1167.
- **Toffoli (1.42M)**, dominant consumers: (1) the symmetric schoolbook square (`n(n−1)/2` crosses, build+unbuild), (2) the two GCD passes' subtract adders ×258×2×(fwd+rev), (3) apply cofactor add/sub + fused double-cdouble, (4) codec compress/decompress (~18 Tof/Triple), (5) narrow comparators. **All AND-uncomputes are vented → 0 Toffoli**; Toffoli is spent only on forward carry chains, square ANDs, and gated register adds.

## 2. The 1167→1163q cascade (everything after tob-joe)

> **Measurement caveat:** almost every commit rewrites whole `.rs` files with LF↔CRLF churn, producing cosmetic symmetric `+N/-N` diffs. Below, only genuine content changes are listed (normalized away the CRLF noise).

### 2.1 The three *free* −1-qubit peak drops (1167→1164, constant-lane parking)
Each removes one qubit from the GCD-divstep peak by eliminating or **loaning back** a provably-constant low-bit lane (via the external `B::loan_zero_qubit`/`reclaim_zero_qubit` primitives), at roughly Toffoli-neutral cost. (The fourth drop, 1164→1163, is *paid* — see §2.5.)

- **`ab1b2d6` (PhantasticUniverse) 1167→1166, also −1.39M Toffoli.** Eliminates the dedicated `swap_flag` ancilla at the step-0 divstep: it becomes `Option<QubitId>`, allocated lazily only for steps ≥1; at step 0 the swap control *is* the `subtracted` qubit. A new codec `compress_step0_with_t1` folds the `t1` first-shift prefix bit into the step-0 symbol with one `ccx(t1,s2,sub)`, freeing both the `sub` and `swap` slots and dropping `tape_len` by 1. The freed `t1` prefix qubit is the −1; the cheaper step-0 path is the Toffoli win.
- **`cea9f5f` (BitWonka) 1166→1165.** "Park odd u0": `u[0]` is provably 1 (u odd invariant), so `park_known_one` does `X→|0>` then `loan_zero_qubit` to return the lane to the pool during the high-bit adder; `restore_known_one` reverses it. Knobs `TLM_PARK_ODD_U0=1`, `TLM_LOAN_ODD_U0=1`.
- **`f8d23a9` (BitWonka) 1165→1164** (Toffoli ticks *up* +329, accepted trade). "Park even v0" + "loan gcd y0": `v[0]` is provably 0 (v even) and the controlled-add's `y[0]` is a known constant; loan both lanes during the high-bit adder. A new `GcdBit0Mode::{ForwardKnownOneAfterCx, ReverseKnownZeroBeforeCx}` **delays the bit-0 CNOT** until after the high-bit adder so `y[0]` can be borrowed. Knobs `TLM_PARK_EVEN_V0`, `TLM_LOAN_EVEN_V0`, `TLM_LOAN_GCD_Y0`.

The common pattern: **provably-constant lanes in the GCD divstep (odd-u0=1, even-v0=0, known y0) are not held live — they are parked/loaned back to the free pool across the adder that needs the headroom.**

### 2.2 The big Toffoli wins
- **`bc2334a` (BitWonka) −5.9M — largest single win.** An **exhaustive-search adaptive chunked carry layout** (`searched_cout_layout`, `searched_gcd_adaptive_layout`, `adaptive_chunk_size` in `gidney.rs`): for each controlled clean-add of width n, search all `(chunk_size, plain_len)` splits minimizing carry-ancilla cost `2n + chunked_len + nchunks ± 1` under a `k`-qubit budget. Gated by `TLM_COUT_LAYOUT_SEARCH`, `TLM_GCD_ADAPTIVE_LAYOUT_SEARCH`. (Also reverts b1dec1e's identity and deletes the dead `single_ccx_fanout` staging.)
- **`497cc20` (gopikannappan) −1.38M.** Adds `constprop.rs`: a sound classical constant-propagation post-pass over `{Zero,One,Unknown}` seeding all qubits |0> except input regs. CCX with provably-0 control → **drop** (removes a Toffoli); provably-1 control → **fold to CX** (demotes to uncounted Clifford). Includes a `CONSTPROP_VERIFY` simulator cross-check. *This is a generic post-pass that any of these circuits benefits from — it just deletes Toffoli the structure made constant.*
- **`b1dec1e` (nasqret) −1.25M.** `toggle_dnot_e_from_intersection`: the identity `d & !e = d ^ (e & d)` computes `d AND NOT e` with **2 CX instead of 1 CCX**, reusing the already-live `cc = e AND d` — one Toffoli saved per call across ~6 fused-primitive sites.
- **`a47dc6e` (PhantasticUniverse) −1.19M — looks like a knob flip, is a structural one-liner.** Two divstep loops change `for j in 0..current_n` → `1..current_n`, **skipping j=0**. Because cea9f5f/f8d23a9 made `u[0]`/`v[0]` provably constant, the j=0 cswap is a provable no-op — one cswap (Toffoli) saved per GCD iteration over ~258 iters. Pure structural edit *enabled by* the parking commits.
- **`b02b354` / `9798bc9` / `fa7126d` (gopikannappan) −0.46M / −0.36M / −0.43M.** Extend `constprop.rs` (25KB→70KB) with **affine/XOR-relation tracking** + **inverse-pair detection** — drop/fold CCX when a control is provably XOR-equal to a known wire, beyond plain constants. (Re-added several times because the qubit-drop commits keep reverting it to the base version.)
- **`12c7337` (PhantasticUniverse) −0.10M.** Turns the `single_ccx_fanout` peephole from a single pass into a **fixpoint loop** (apply until no rewrite).
- **`b310de9` (BitWonka) — this is the 1164→1163 *qubit* drop, not just a knob tweak. Analyzed in detail in §2.5 below.**

### 2.3 Knob/schedule/infra-only commits
`a9ac507` (jieyilong, fold-vent schedule knobs `LUD_EXTRA_FOLD_*`), `c9c03de` (jackylee, adds the `TRAILMIX_*_DELTA` overlay infra), `75851e6` (bket7, comparator-width margin), `ed2715f` (gnuchev, layout-search margin tuning), `916c0e3`, `01560c7` — all small knob/table tweaks on top of the above structures.

### 2.4 Pure nonce grinds (cosmetic for circuit structure)
`615ce9a`, `5407215`, `fd89e69`, `550595a`, `f265bb1`, `fdb103e`, `6a9db88`, and `70bf11a` — these changed only `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE` (a Fiat-Shamir island grind that re-seeds which clean island the verifier hits; score-neutral in gate count, but a different nonce can shave a few Toffoli by landing a cleaner schedule). `70bf11a` staged a `single_ccx_fanout.rs` but left it un-wired (dead code at that commit).

### 2.5 The *paid* −1q drop: 1164→1163 (`b310de9`, BitWonka — `175749f`, 1163q × 1,412,402 = 1,642,623,526; superseded by §2.6)

This is categorically different from the three free parking drops in §2.1. It does **not** find a new constant lane to park — it **buys** the 1163rd-qubit reduction by surrendering vents at the binding apply phase (and tightening the truncation windows), paying **+419 Toffoli** for **−1 peak**. The +419 is dwarfed by the −1-qubit factor (each peak qubit at this scale is worth ~1.41M of score), so the net is **−924,686** even though Toffoli went *up*. Verified: `constprop.rs`'s giant diff is pure CRLF churn — the real content is four small edits:

1. **Apply-schedule vent/cap reductions via the overlay deltas** (`mod.rs`, the new `sub_delta`/`env_delta` machinery): `TLM_HYB_V_DELTA=2` (−2 hybrid-adder vents), `TLM_COUT_K_DELTA=1` (−1 apply cofactor-add carry-cap), `TLM_FFG_DELTA=2` (−2 `+f`-fold clean-vents), `TLM_FOLD_DELTA=1`. **Removing vents at the binding apply phase frees the transient vent qubits that own the peak** — this is the mechanism that drops 1164→1163. Each removed vent is +1 Toffoli (the carry-uncompute reverts from a 0-Toffoli MBU back to a real CCX), which is most of the +419.
2. **`PAD` 21→19** (`arith.rs`) and **21→20** (`schedule.rs`): tightens the truncation windows (`LSBS = PAD + F_BITLEN`, `MSBS = PAD`). Narrower `+f` folds and comparators mean fewer live bits *and* fewer Toffoli, at the cost of a higher per-fire miss rate (`2^-19` instead of `2^-21`). This partially *offsets* the vent-cost Toffoli increase and shrinks the truncation-region live width.
3. **`maybe_adjust_late_gcd_k`** (`gcd.rs`): a window-gated GCD-subtract carry-cap trim — for divstep iters `[172,196)`, `k -= 1` (`TLM_GCD_K_ADJUST=-1`, `_AFTER=172`, `_BEFORE=196`). Fewer held carries in that late-GCD window.
4. A fresh `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE` (`100000688994`) grinding a clean island under the now-tighter (`PAD=19/20`) miss budget across all 9024 shots, and replacing the old `LUD_EXTRA_FOLD_*` fold-vent values with `0` (the apply-delta relaxations subsume them).

**The lesson:** §2.1's three drops were *free* (park a constant lane, Toffoli ≈ neutral). This fourth drop is the **qubit↔Toffoli exchange rate run in reverse** — the skill's vent primitive normally says "vent OFF-peak for free Toffoli; venting the binding phase costs score." Here, *un-venting* the binding phase **buys** a peak qubit, and at 1163q each peak qubit (~1.41M) is worth far more than the +419 Toffoli surrendered. Tightening `PAD` against the verifier tolerance is the companion lever that keeps the net Toffoli cost small. This is the first drop in the cascade that spends Toffoli to buy a qubit, and it confirms the exchange-rate model is *the* live lever at the ludicrous floor.

### 2.6 The 6/19–6/20 burst: Karatsuba square, NAF recoding, and the qubit↔Toffoli bifurcation

After the 1163q floor (§2.5), a second wave (`b310de9`→`3df690f`, 6/19 12:50 PM → 6/20 7:54 AM) cut **another ~32M Toffoli** and reshaped the frontier into two competing operating points. The decisive moves are structural arithmetic, not nonce grinding. (As before, most commits carry LF↔CRLF whole-file churn; only genuine content is reported.)

#### The Toffoli wins (the big story this burst)

- **`28fe2f2` (alexander-sei) −22,382,556 — the single biggest Toffoli win in the entire saga, from a +175/−47 diff.** **Karatsuba decomposition of the modular square** (`square.rs::mod_square_sub_pm_secp256k1_symmetric`). The 256-bit symmetric schoolbook square (`symmetric_square_into_prod`, ~`n(n−1)/2 ≈ 32,640` CCX of cross-products) is replaced by a hi/lo split `λ = hi·2^128 + lo` computing `A = lo²`, `B = hi²`, `C = (lo+hi)²`, then `λ² = A + (C−A−B)·2^128 + B·2^256`. Three n=128 squares cost `3 × 128·127/2 ≈ 24,384` CCX + a few 128-bit Cuccaro carries (`build_sum_hi_lo`/`unbuild_sum_hi_lo`, `mod_add_lowpeak`, `apply_shifted_128`) — **~25% fewer cross-product Toffoli on the dominant cost-center.** Each half-square is uncomputed before the next is built, so the peak stays 1164. **The leverage is the per-square O(n²) cross-product count multiplied across every divstep round — which is why a tiny diff moves ~1.5% of total Toffoli.** *(One level of Karatsuba pays; recursing further does NOT — see §2.9, recursive Karatsuba was measured to be a net loss.)*

- **`4ea8b74` (alexander-sei) −1,092,526 — NAF recoding of the secp256k1 prime + doubling-ramp elimination.** The 7-set-bit expansion of `f = 2^32+977` (`F_BITS = [0,4,6,7,8,9,32]`) is replaced by a **5-term non-adjacent-form recoding** `F_NAF_TERMS`: `f = 2^32 + 2^10 − 2^6 + 2^4 + 1` (`ShiftOp::Add/Sub`). The `f·hi` reduction loop no longer walks `hi` with a `mod_double` ramp (+ matched `mod_double_reverse`); it reads `hi` at fixed bit offsets via new `apply_shifted_hi_term`/`mod_add_shifted_low`/`mod_sub_shifted_low` with implicit shifted-in zero low bits (**no pad qubits**). Fewer reduction terms *and* the whole doubling ramp removed.

- **`e25c7d8` (0xLucqs) −848,868 — hoist the `<<32` NAF term out of the doubling ramp.** `apply_f_times_value_tagged()` + `apply_shifted_value_direct()`: for tagged lanes (`TLM_SQUARE_F_RAMP10_DIRECT32_TAGS=a`) the `shift==32` term is emitted **once** as a single padded direct shifted add instead of 32 `mod_double` steps.

- **`d2643bc` (nasqret) −377,136 — deeper constprop fixpoint.** `CONSTPROP_MAX_ITERS` 16→256 (`constprop.rs`): lets the constant-propagation + affine-fold post-pass run to a deeper fixpoint, materializing more cascaded CCX→CX/X drops. *Pure knob; the post-pass already existed (§2.2).*

- **`3df690f` (gopikannappan) −1,870,580 — CURRENT SOTA, 1164q × 1,380,610.** Two Toffoli levers: (a) **fold-vent knob** `LUD_EXTRA_FOLD_VENTS=2` (`LUD_EXTRA_FOLD_MIN_G=16`) — `load_schedule` raises the FFG fold `g`-values by +2 (cap 53) for fold rounds with `g≥16`, i.e. **more Gidney measurement-vented (0-Toffoli) uncompute in the GCD fold rounds**; (b) **all-NAF-terms shifted-low square** `TLM_SQUARE_F_SHIFTED_LOW=1` (disables the per-tag ramp10+direct32 mix) — every `f·hi` term goes through the pad-free `mod_add_shifted_low`/`mod_sub_shifted_low` from `4ea8b74`. The fold-vents cost peak headroom (which is *why* the peak floated back up to 1164 — see the bifurcation below).

- **Cosmetic / nonce-only:** `eb089b1`, `3b05e0a`, `41df0b5`, `533ef88`, `883f71a`, `94d44be` are pure `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE` grinds (+CRLF churn) — no circuit change.

#### The qubit drops (the low-qubit branch)

- **`31421df` (jieyilong) 1164→1162 (−2q in one commit), 1,391,406.** Two width-narrowing mechanisms (no new parking lanes): (1) **`PAD` 21→20/19** (the `+f`-reduction carry-cap — drops reduction-carry scratch lanes from the apply/reduce peak); (2) **`maybe_adjust_gcd_k`** (`gcd.rs`, consumed at the `controlled_add_active` carry cap) — `TLM_GCD_K_ADJUST=-1` over divstep window `[172,196)` narrows the per-GCD-subtract carry-chunk by 1, removing one live carry ancilla from the GCD band. Plus apply-vent deltas (`TLM_HYB_V_DELTA=2`, `TLM_COUT_K_DELTA=2`, `TLM_FFG_DELTA=1`, `TLM_FOLD_DELTA=2`). Mechanism = **static schedule-width / carry-cap narrowing + vent surrender.**

- **`fed64cf` (nasqret) 1162→1159 (−3q), 1,388,180 — a dynamic live-headroom clamp engine.** New helper `target_qubit_headroom(circ) = TLM_TARGET_Q − circ.active_qubits` (`mod.rs`, `TLM_TARGET_Q=1159`). **Every transient-allocating arithmetic primitive clamps its carry/chunk width to `min(scheduled_k, headroom)`, so no local peak can exceed 1159.** Applied at: the FFG half-product reserve (`arith.rs`, `TLM_TARGET_FFG_RESERVE=9` + per-step `TLM_TARGET_FFG_CALL_RESERVES`), the fold-vent reserve (`fused.rs`, `TLM_TARGET_FOLD_RESERVE=4` + `TLM_FOLD_RELEASE_CONTROLS=1`), the comparator carry, and the Gidney adders (`gidney.rs`, `TLM_GCD_RESELECT_LAYOUT=1` reselects a narrower layout, `TLM_DIRECT_VARCHUNK=1` forces direct var-chunk carries). It **generalizes `31421df`'s static `GCD_K_ADJUST` into a dynamic per-call clamp** that pays Toffoli (narrower = more-chunked adds) to hold the peak at a target. *This is a powerful, reusable qubit lever: a circuit-wide "do not exceed N live qubits" governor.*

- **`aacf05c`/`7b7bd12` (gnuchev/BitWonka) 1162q** — same 1162 island with square-path Toffoli swaps + GCD-window retunes (`TLM_GCD_K_ADJUST=-2` starting at index 169); peak-neutral.

#### The bifurcation and the exchange-rate rule (the key conceptual development)

`3df690f` (SOTA) **reverted `fed64cf`'s entire clamp engine** (the −2081 lines: `target_qubit_headroom`, all `TLM_TARGET_*`, `TLM_FOLD_RELEASE_CONTROLS`, `TLM_GCD_RESELECT_LAYOUT`, `TLM_DIRECT_VARCHUNK`, `TLM_GCD_K_ADJUST` — all gone), reverted **`PAD` back to 21/21**, and let the peak **float back to 1164** so every adder runs at full (cheaper-Toffoli) chunk width. The two resulting operating points:

`3df690f` spends **+5 peak qubits to save 7,570 avg Toffoli ⇒ a realized exchange of ≈1,514 Toffoli/qubit.** The **break-even** at this width is the marginal score cost of one peak qubit = `T_avg / q ≈ 1,388,180 / 1159 ≈ 1,198 Toffoli/qubit`. Because `fed64cf`'s clamp was buying qubits at ~1,514 Toffoli each — **above** the ~1,198 break-even — clamping to 1159 *on that base* lost on the product, and `3df690f` won by floating to 1164q.

#### The resolution (`d11bdbb`, BitWonka — CURRENT SOTA `88ed0f5`, 1159q × 1,380,711 = 1,600,244,049)

The bifurcation did **not** last. `d11bdbb` **re-stacks `fed64cf`'s entire headroom-clamp engine on top of `3df690f`'s cheap arithmetic** — confirmed in the route config: `TLM_TARGET_Q=1159`, `TLM_TARGET_FFG_RESERVE=9`, `TLM_TARGET_FOLD_RESERVE=4`, `TLM_FOLD_RELEASE_CONTROLS=1`, `TLM_GCD_RESELECT_LAYOUT=1`, `TLM_DIRECT_VARCHUNK=1`, `TLM_GCD_K_ADJUST=-2` over `[169,196)`, all reappear (and `target_qubit_headroom` returns to `arith.rs`/`gidney.rs`). Critically it **turns the fold-vents OFF** (`LUD_EXTRA_FOLD_VENTS=0`) — those vents were `3df690f`'s way to cut Toffoli at 1164q, but each costs peak headroom, which is incompatible with the 1159 clamp. The Karatsuba square + all-shifted-low reduction are kept. Full operating-point picture:

| Operating point | peak q | avg Toffoli | score (q×T) | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fed64cf` (clamp on *expensive* square) | **1159** | 1,388,180 | 1,608,900,620 | low-qubit branch |
| `3df690f` (cheap arith, no clamp, +fold-vents) | **1164** | 1,380,610 | 1,607,030,040 | low-Toffoli branch |
| `d11bdbb` (cheap arith **+** clamp, **SOTA**) | **1159** | 1,380,711 | **1,600,244,049** | best-of-both |

**Why the resolution works — the break-even is per-base, and a structural Toffoli win revives a shelved qubit lever.** Re-clamping `3df690f` from 1164q→1159q costs only **+101 Toffoli for −5 qubits ≈ 20 Toffoli/qubit** — vs the ~1,514/qubit the *same clamp* cost `fed64cf` on the old schoolbook-square base. The clamp's job is to narrow carry chunks on the adders; once Karatsuba removed the wide schoolbook-square adds the clamp was fighting, the incremental cost of chunking what remains collapsed by ~75×. So the lever that *lost* at one base *wins decisively* at a cheaper-arithmetic base. The two levers **compose**; they were never truly in opposition — the bifurcation was an artifact of testing the clamp before the arithmetic was cheap.

**The reusable rule (refined):** a peak qubit is worth `avg_Toffoli / peak_qubits` Toffoli (~1,190 at the 1159q floor), and a width-narrowing lever (PAD, GCD-k, headroom clamp, vent surrender) is net-positive **only if it removes a qubit for fewer than that many Toffoli**. But the realized cost is **per-base, not fixed**: a structural Toffoli win (Karatsuba, NAF) that shrinks the adders the clamp narrows can drop that cost by orders of magnitude. **⇒ After any structural arithmetic change, re-test every shelved qubit lever — the break-even moved.** Always divide a candidate lever's realized Toffoli-delta by its qubit-delta and compare to the *current* `T_avg/q`.

> *Cosmetic in this sub-burst:* `42b56c6`/`977a9e1` (welttowelt) is a pure `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE` grind (−20,952, a cleaner island on the 1164q base); `218d068` (jieyilong) and `e2d639c` (Jamgiter) are *failed* builds (n/a metrics). The high-qubit `abipalli` 2045q experiments (`1bace3e`/`98f4dbc`, +46%) remain rejected.

### 2.7 The 1159q Toffoli-grind (6/20 10:42 AM → 4:10 PM): GAP_J2, converged-tail cswap, doubling-ramp removal — SOTA 1,378,242

With the 1159q best-of-both floor set, a third wave ground the Toffoli from 1,380,711 down to **1,378,242** (`f8e215b`/`4966254`, gopikannappan — current SOTA, 1159q × 1,378,242 = 1,597,382,478). All at 1159q. Three durable lever families emerged (plus oscillating churn), all reusable:

- **⭐ `f0c1c42` (bket7) −1,335,168 — the highest-leverage lever per line of diff in the whole saga: a 22-line `GAP_J2` schedule-table edit.** `GAP_J2[i]` (`schedule.rs`, len 258) is the per-step swap-decision comparator **window width** for the jump=2 GCD; `gcd.rs` sets `cmp_eff = GAP_J2[i].min(current_n).max(1)`, and the held Gidney carries / compared MSBs in `compare_geq_chunked_middle` (`comparator.rs`) scale with it. Shaving ~1 bit/step across **258 steps × 2 GCD passes** is the −1.33M. **Cost (island-exact):** mis-decides the u↔v swap with prob ~`2^-k` when the top differing bit falls just below the window — recovered by the tail-nonce hunt. This is the swap-comparator analogue of the `PAD` truncation; sweep one notch at a time.

- **⭐ Converged-tail cswap elision** (`5c34dd1` `TLM_APPLY_FWD_FIRST_CSWAP_SKIP` → `9d524b7` `TLM_APPLY_CSWAP_SKIP_LASTK`, ~−151k+). On the last K GCD iters the apply `cswap`'s swap-decision is deterministically 0 for all-but-rare inputs (the GCD has converged), so it's a no-op — skip it (`apply_cswap_skip_dir` in `gcd.rs`). Island-exact, huntable. A structural instance of "elide a data-dependent gate that is known-0 on the island."

- **⭐ `f8e215b` (SOTA) −156,465 — doubling-ramp elimination in the Karatsuba reduction.** The `f·value mod q` NAF reduction (`square.rs::apply_f_times_value_tagged`) no longer builds a 257-bit `ext` register and walks a `mod_double` ramp to each NAF shift offset; a new default branch applies each term `±(value≪shift) mod q` **directly** via `apply_shifted_hi_term` (`mod_add_shifted_low`/`mod_sub_shifted_low` for in-range bits + per-wrapped-bit `add_f_window_shifted`/`sub_f_window_shifted` pseudo-Mersenne folds for the bits wrapping past 255). Value-exact, gate-for-gate equal in result — the entire doubling/un-doubling shuffle is removed. *Extends `4ea8b74`'s shifted-low idea into the Karatsuba reduce; audit any surviving `mod_double`-ramp shift.*

- **`5c34dd1` also added `TLM_GRAD_FINAL_NO_COUT`** (`const_chunk_add_clean_drop_cout`, `arith.rs`): drop the unneeded final carry-out of the top constant-add chunk and MBU-vent (`hmr`+`cz_if_bit`, 0 Toffoli) the chunk's carries instead of a CCX.

- **`662e267` (bket7) −188,917 — classical-constant folding (Q is classical → constant arithmetic is free).** Rewrote `coord_add3x` (`dst += 3·ox mod q`) to derive `3·ox mod q` entirely in the **classical `BitId` domain** (`classical_times3_mod_q`, all `BitStore/BitInvert`, 0 Toffoli) then one `mod_add_exact` — removing the doubling + 2nd mod-add + 257-bit temp. *(Caveat: this oscillated in/out across `5f3a0e3`/`f6ce76d`/`5c34dd1` vs a peak concern — it trades Toffoli for a transient; check peak before keeping.)*

- **Oscillating / minor:** the `GAP_J2` *mid-range* −1 (steps 112–218) was toggled in and out (`5f3a0e3`/`f6ce76d` narrow, `f8e215b` reverts it +1 and pays it back with the square win); `f861f87` bumped the `*_DELTA` knobs 2→3 (near-neutral) + nonce; several commits flip the classical-3·ox fold back and forth.

**The 1157q break-even data point (`6ba606a`, jieyilong, 1159→1157, promoted but NOT SOTA).** A −2-qubit drop done purely by lowering the headroom-clamp ceiling **`TLM_TARGET_Q` 1159→1157** (the `target_qubit_headroom` body byte-identical), paid for with new per-call FFG reserve overrides (`TLM_TARGET_FFG_CALL_RESERVE_DELTAS`/`_OVERRIDES`), a **lazy-cin0 fold** (`TLM_FOLD_CHUNK_LAZY_CIN0` — allocate the chunk carry only inside the boundary-erase, deferring one carry's liveness), an apply inv-first cswap skip, and vent deltas 3→2. Realized exchange: **+2,255 Toffoli / 2 qubits ≈ 1,127 Toffoli/qubit**, just *under* the ~1,189 break-even, so it **won −148,235 at landing**. But the parallel 1159q Toffoli-grind independently reached 1,378,242, and `1159 × 1,378,242 = 1,597,382,478 < 1157 × 1,380,890 = 1,597,689,730` — so the wider, cheaper-Toffoli base wins the **product** even though it has more qubits. **Lesson: a width drop that clears break-even can still lose the product race to a cheaper-Toffoli wider base — run both tracks and compare products, never optimize qubit count in isolation.**

### 2.8 Empirical dead-CCX elimination — a new lever class (6/20 6 PM → 6/21 7 AM): SOTA 1,364,380

This wave's headline is **not** a knob or an arithmetic rewrite — it is an **offline screen that deletes provably-inert gates by op-index**. It is the biggest avg-Toffoli drop of any single technique since Karatsuba, and it opens a fresh, open-ended axis.

- **⭐⭐ `4a90d04` (zuiris) — introduces the dead-op drop framework (−13,015 avg-T → 1,365,621; the prompt's "−13.95M" is the *product*-score delta).** `build()` (in `src/point_add/mod.rs`, ~L2064, *after* the `single_ccx_fanout` rewrite) loads `include_str!("drop_dead_robust_13873.idx")` (13,873 op indices, one per line) into a `HashSet<usize>` and filters: `ops = ops.into_iter().enumerate().filter(|(i,_)| !drop.contains(i))…`. The 13,873 are **inert-but-charged CCX** — real `ccx` ops the scorer charges, but whose net effect on the validated island is zero — deleted once, removed from every shot's executed count. The accompanying ±14k-line churn is a **route revert**, not the win: zuiris abandoned the predecessor's q1156 fold/cswap route (reset `TLM_TARGET_Q`→1159, removed `classical_times3_mod_q`/coord_add3x back to `coord+2·coord`, deleted the q1156 helpers) and **added recursive-Karatsuba scaffolding in `square.rs` (`kara_square_into_prod`, `x²=A+M·2^h+B·2^2h`, `M=C−A−B`) that is GATED OFF** (`TLM_SQUARE_KARA2` never set, threshold 96) — so the n=128 halves still use schoolbook. *The recursive-Karatsuba follow-up flagged in §2.6 is now scaffolded but unwired — wiring it on is unclaimed.*

- **⭐⭐ `20b9a1d` (mpjunior92) — extends it to DYNAMIC dead-CCX, reaching SOTA 1159q × 1,364,380 = 1,581,316,420 (−1,439,478).** Swaps the baked list to `drop_dead_robust_15221.idx` (in-tree, 15,221 indices, max index ~10.1M = post-fanout stream size) and re-hunts the nonce. The new 1,348 extras (15,221 − 13,873) are the key idea: **CCX whose target never flips across ~9.2M random valid EC-point inputs** — the two controls are **dynamically mutually-exclusive on the reachable EC-point distribution**, something the static `constprop.rs` cannot prove from the circuit graph. The screen is empirical (simulate over the reachable distribution, record per-CCX target-flip), the drop is by post-fanout op-index, and it stacks *on top of* both static constprop and the `single_ccx_fanout` peephole.

  **The mechanism as a reusable lever:** (1) build the full op stream (constprop + fanout already applied); (2) simulate over millions of *reachable* inputs (valid EC points), tracking whether each CCX's target ever flips; (3) the never-flipping CCX are inert-but-charged → emit their post-fanout indices to a `.idx` file; (4) `include_str!` + filter them out in `build()`; (5) **re-hunt `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE`** (the drop re-rolls the FS island). **Correctness regime: distribution/island-exact, NOT all-inputs value-exact** — it removes ops that *could* fire on unreachable inputs, so it is only valid on the hunted island (the comment is explicit: "NEEDS A FRESH ISLAND HUNT"; the old 13,873-base nonce is not clean for the 15,221 set). **Peak-neutral** (only avg-executed Toffoli drops). **Open-ended: a bigger or fresher screen finds more dead CCX** — this is the most promising live axis.

- **`9af02f7` (gnuchev) −282,796:** generalized the converged-tail cswap elision to the **inverse pass + first iter** — new knobs `TLM_APPLY_INV_FIRST_CSWAP_SKIP` (the live win), `TLM_APPLY_FWD_LAST_CSWAP_SKIP`, `TLM_APPLY_INV_LAST_CSWAP_SKIP`, `TLM_APPLY_INV_FIRST_SUB_SKIP` (early-return, elides a sub). Enumerating all four FWD/INV × FIRST/LAST corners of the converged GCD. (Also added the `island_search` module — offline nonce tooling.)

- **`cde752d` (BitWonka) 1156q — the SECOND product-race loss.** A −3-qubit drop via `TLM_TARGET_Q` 1159→1156, paid for with a new direct-zero fold path (`fold_boundary_erase_zero_direct`, `TLM_FOLD_BOUNDARY_ZERO_DIRECT`, `hmr`+`push_condition` measurement-erase, `TLM_FOLD_CHUNK_FORCE=4`), per-call reserve-override tables (`TLM_TARGET_{FOLD,FFG}_CALL_RESERVE_OVERRIDES`), and FWD/INV cswap-skip + `S2_ZERO_LAST` knobs. Exchange: **+3,274 Toffoli / 3 qubits ≈ 1,091 Toffoli/qubit**, *under* the ~1,189 break-even — yet `1156 × 1,381,234 = 1,596,706,504 > 1,581,316,420` (SOTA). **Same trap as `6ba606a`, now confirmed twice: clearing per-base break-even is necessary but not sufficient — the Toffoli track is falling faster than width drops can keep up.**

- **Nonce grinds:** `85ee6af` (−3,477) and `c07bf74` (−40,565) are pure `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE` changes — note `c07bf74` shaved 40k avg-Toffoli on the *same topology* just by landing a cleaner FS island, a reminder that nonce choice alone moves the *executed* count.

### 2.9 Recursive Karatsuba / Toom-3 on the square: TESTED, net Toffoli LOSS (2026-06-21)

Direct experiment on the SOTA (`20b9a1d`): clone, build, enable the scaffolded recursive Karatsuba, measure. **Verdict: it does not work in this circuit, and the reason is a general lesson about reversible cost models.** Reproducible measurements (worktree, `build_circuit` → parse `ops.bin`):

- **The scaffolding was buggy** — `TLM_SQUARE_KARA2=1` panicked (`EXIT=101`, `cuccaro_carry: x,y width mismatch 65 vs 66`) in `unbuild_kara_sum`: the unbuild padded `lo_ext` to `g` bits but subtracted it against the full `g+1`-bit `s`. (Fix: pad to `s.len()`. A stale-`ops.bin` artifact briefly made it *look* like a no-op before the exit code was checked.)
- **After the fix it builds but LOSES on both axes.** The square's own CCX went **117,016 → 177,180 = +60,164 from a single split**, and worse at every recursion depth (threshold 96 → +66.8k total CCX; 64 → +113.9k; 48 → +169.4k; 32 → +277.1k). It also leaked the three-product live set, raising peak **1159 → 1612**.
- **Root cause (the transferable lesson):** the modular square is only **8.14% of CCX** and has **647 qubits of off-peak slack** (it enters at 512 live, while the global 1159 peak is set earlier by the GCD inversion) — so the *qubit room for Karatsuba exists*. But the schoolbook **symmetric** square's cross-products are already **~1 MBU-vented CCX each**, whereas Karatsuba replaces them with **un-vented wide recombination adds** (`hybrid_add_adaptive`, ~3 CCX/bit). The recombination costs more than the multiplies it removes, so the classical asymptotic win **inverts** in this reversible cost model. **Toom-3 is strictly worse** (5 evaluation points + `/3`/`/6` interpolation divisions, all un-vented).
- **Implication:** arithmetic restructuring of the square is exhausted — one level of Karatsuba (`28fe2f2`) was the win; there is no cheaper arithmetic left. The live Toffoli levers are all *gate-level* (dead-CCX elimination, venting, comparator narrowing), which win precisely because they shave the already-near-optimal arithmetic without adding un-vented work. **Do not re-attempt recursive Karatsuba / Toom-3** unless someone first re-engineers the recombination adds to be MBU-vented *and* recurses to deep leaves *and* fixes the leak — high effort for a sub-2% ceiling.

## 3. Key insights / takeaways

1. **The wall broke on a family change, not a knob.** The dialog-GCD route was at a local floor (1168q). tob-joe's port of the **product-min "ludicrous"** point — *classical Q + two-shared-GCD-passes + live-compressed dialog tape* — reset the floor to 1167 and opened a fresh ladder.

2. **Classical `Q` (−512q) is the single most important structural decision.** Holding the second point classically and materializing it only in a transient temp at off-peak steps is what makes a 256-bit-arithmetic point-add fit under 1168 qubits at all.

3. **The qubit floor is the GCD shrink/regrow width schedule, and there are TWO ways to lower it.** Peak qubits are set by what's co-resident at the forward-multiply apply: two coord regs + the 603q compressed tape + early-width GCD state + transient vent ancilla. (a) **Free** drops (1167→1164): **don't hold provably-constant low bits live — park/loan them back across the adder that needs the headroom** (odd-u0=1, even-v0=0, known-y0, redundant step-0 swap_flag); Toffoli ≈ neutral. (b) **Paid** drop (1164→1163, `b310de9`): **surrender vents at the binding apply phase** — un-venting frees the transient vent qubits that own the peak, costing +Toffoli (each removed vent = +1 CCX) but buying a peak qubit worth far more.

4. **Toffoli is shaved FOUR ways, all reusable.** (a) **Better arithmetic at the dominant cost-center** — the biggest single win was `28fe2f2`'s **Karatsuba modular square** (−22.4M, ~25% off the O(n²) cross-product count that runs every divstep round), and `4ea8b74`'s **NAF recoding** of `f = 2^32+977` (7→5 terms, doubling-ramp eliminated). *When a primitive runs ×258×2 or is O(n²), a structural improvement has enormous leverage from a tiny diff — audit the square and the reduction first, BUT only if the replacement ops are as cheap as the ones removed: recursive Karatsuba past the first level was measured to be a net loss (§2.9) because the schoolbook square's cross-products are already vented while Karatsuba's recombination adds are not.* (b) **Empirical / dynamic dead-CCX elimination (the current biggest lever, §2.8)** — simulate over ~9.2M reachable EC-point inputs, find CCX whose target never flips (controls dynamically mutually-exclusive on the reachable distribution, which static constprop can't prove), drop them by post-fanout op-index via a baked `.idx` list. Distribution/island-exact, peak-neutral, needs a fresh nonce hunt, and **open-ended** (a bigger screen finds more). (c) A *generic sound static post-pass* (`constprop` + affine/XOR/inverse-pair; `CONSTPROP_MAX_ITERS` controls fixpoint depth). (d) *Schedule-level* tricks: `GAP_J2` comparator-width narrowing (−1.33M from 22 lines), converged-tail cswap elision (all FWD/INV × FIRST/LAST corners), exhaustive carry-chunk layout search, fold-vent counts, MBU venting everywhere.

5. **Aggressive truncation is a deliberate, budgeted error — and the companion to the paid qubit drop.** `PAD=21` (now 19–20 after `b310de9`) means each `+f` fold and comparator accepts a ~`2^-19`-per-fire miss; the 9024-shot verifier tolerates it, and `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE` grinds the inputs so all draws land in the schedule-supported set. Tightening `PAD` shrinks both the live truncation width *and* the Toffoli, which is what kept the net cost of the 1164→1163 vent surrender to only +419 Toffoli. `PAD` is a live lever in **both** directions (qubits and Toffoli).

6. **The qubit↔Toffoli exchange rate is THE meta-lever — and its cost is PER-BASE, not fixed.** A peak qubit is worth exactly `avg_Toffoli / peak_qubits` Toffoli (≈1,190 at the 1159q floor). A width-narrowing lever (PAD, GCD-k trim, the headroom clamp, vent surrender) is net-positive **only if it removes a qubit for fewer than that many Toffoli**. The 6/19–6/20 burst proved both that the rule is live *and* that the cost moves: `fed64cf`'s clamp-to-1159 cost ~1,514 Toffoli/qubit on the old schoolbook-square base (above break-even) and **lost** to `3df690f` (which floated to 1164q) — but once `28fe2f2`'s Karatsuba removed the wide square adds the clamp was fighting, **the same clamp cost only ~20 Toffoli/qubit** and `d11bdbb` re-stacked it to win at **1159q × 1,380,711 (current SOTA, best-of-both)**. **The lever that lost at one base won decisively at a cheaper-arithmetic base.** ⇒ **After any structural arithmetic change, re-test every shelved qubit lever — the break-even moved.** Always divide a candidate's realized Toffoli-delta by its qubit-delta and compare to the *current* `T_avg/q`. The qubit and Toffoli levers **compose**; they are rarely truly in opposition. **Corollary (the product-race trap, §2.7–§2.8): now confirmed TWICE.** Even a width drop that *clears* break-even can lose the **product** race to a cheaper-Toffoli *wider* base. `6ba606a` (1157q, ~1,127 Toffoli/qubit) and `cde752d` (1156q, ~1,091 Toffoli/qubit) both cleared per-base break-even and both lost the SOTA, because the 1159q Toffoli-grind fell faster (`1159 × 1,364,380 < 1156 × 1,381,234 < 1157 × 1,380,890`). Run both tracks and compare *products*; never optimize qubit count in isolation — and right now the Toffoli track (esp. dead-CCX elimination) is winning.

7. **The shrunken-PZ floor keeps dropping but is still not score-competitive — the gap is ~33×, not closeable by qubit records.** The Proos–Zalka low-qubit track has now set qubit records at 1050q (trailmix), 1019q (teddyjfpender `55892ec`/`a77c9da`/`12e483f`, +~280%), and **948q (nasqret `a203fac`, 6/21)** — the last a `trailmix_port` PZ-divstep port (`ec/inversion/shrunken_pz_state_machine.rs`, 8,963 lines) with a new **"q949 robust envelope"** variable-width divstep packing (`q949_robust_envelope.rs` + a projection-metadata JSON). All were **rejected**: 948q × 54,781,961 = 51.9B (+468%), because the PZ Toffoli (~54.8M) is **~40× the ludicrous SOTA's 1.36M** and ~33× over the 948q break-even (`1,581,316,420 / 948 ≈ 1.67M Toffoli`). Pushing the PZ qubit floor lower does *not* help the product — the class would need a ~33× Toffoli reduction (an entirely different inversion cost, not a packing tweak) to compete. The high-qubit experiments (abipalli's 2045q, +46%) lose the other way. **The action is entirely at the 1159–1164q ludicrous operating band**, where the product is minimized; the PZ track is a qubit-lower-bound *witness* only. See `[[ecdsafail-objective-changed-qubit-min-pz1050]]` for the PZ-port mechanism details.

## 4. What this means for our own pushes
- The `trailmix_ludicrous` module is now the **base to fork from**, not the dialog-GCD 1168 route. SOTA = `20b9a1d`/`19cf407`, **1159q × 1,364,380 = 1,581,316,420** (cheap Karatsuba arithmetic + the 1159q headroom clamp, Toffoli-ground via `GAP_J2` narrowing + converged-tail cswap elision + doubling-ramp removal + **empirical dead-CCX elimination**). The single most promising open axis is a **bigger/fresher dead-CCX screen** (§2.8) — peak-neutral, open-ended, additive on everything else. (**Recursive Karatsuba / Toom-3 on the square is a dead end — measured net Toffoli loss, §2.9.**)
- **Arithmetic restructuring of the square is exhausted.** `28fe2f2`'s *one-level* Karatsuba already cut −22.4M, but recursing further (or Toom-3) is a **measured net loss** (§2.9): the schoolbook symmetric square is already vented-cheap, so any restructuring that adds un-vented recombination loses. The remaining Toffoli levers are the *gate-level* ones (dead-CCX, vents, comparator narrowing), not arithmetic.
- The open qubit lever is **three-pronged**: (1) more provably-constant-lane parking (free, easy lanes taken); (2) paid vent surrender + `PAD` tightening (`b310de9`); (3) the **dynamic live-headroom clamp** (`fed64cf`/`d11bdbb`'s `target_qubit_headroom`/`TLM_TARGET_Q`) — a circuit-wide "do not exceed N live qubits" governor that auto-narrows every adder near the ceiling. **These only win if they clear the current `T_avg/q ≈ 1,190` break-even (Insight #6) — the clamp *lost* on the expensive-square base but *won* on the Karatsuba base (~20 Toffoli/qubit), which is the SOTA. Re-test it each time the arithmetic gets cheaper.**
- The open Toffoli lever is **extending the constprop/affine post-pass** (deeper `CONSTPROP_MAX_ITERS` fixpoints already yielded), the **carry-layout search**, and **fold-vent counts** (`LUD_EXTRA_FOLD_VENTS`).
- The `DIALOG_TAIL_NONCE` grind is a cheap, score-positive search any of us can run (offline island tooling, not part of the scored gate count). Every structural change re-rolls the FS island, so it needs a fresh clean-nonce hunt.
